# Vending machine

## Setup
```bash
npm i
```

## Run

This command will run both the frontend build and a server which serves the app on port 8000 and provides the api as an endpoint.
```bash
npm run start
```

### TODO
 - [] Breakdown the App component into smaller more managable components.
 - [] Add inventory so the user can track purchases.
 - [] Rework the change/balance logic. It's lacking at the moment.
